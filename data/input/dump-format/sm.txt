Format: 1v1

Overview: 1v1 is an Unofficial Metagame where players choose a Pokemon that they believe is capable of defeating most—if not all—other Pokemon in a one-on-one situation. Players are allowed to bring a team of three Pokemon to the team preview but must select only one to battle with. So, while your team of three should be able to cover a wide variety of common threats, the Pokemon you send out must be able to beat any of your opponent's Pokemon, or at least the one you think they will use against you.
This metagame is led by Elo Bandit and a council.

Basic Strategy
Brute strength decides a lot of 1v1 matches, so common threats on the ladder include Mega Charizard X and Y, Mega Mawile, and Mega Gyarados. Abilities that dampen the foe's power like Intimidate are useful because your Pokemon will take less damage from physical attacks, giving your Pokemon a turn to set up. Mawile and Gyarados can use this strategy, and Gyarados will Mega Evolve as it Dragon Dances, gaining even more bulk, Speed, and Attack all in one turn.
Because some matches are typically decided within a single turn, recharge moves that would normally have little viability in a standard metagame actually excel here. Mega Charizard Y's ability Drought boosts the power of Blast Burn to staggering levels. Pixilate Mega Gardevoir turns Hyper Beam into a blisteringly strong Fairy-type attack. Also, Mega Pinsir is known for its Aerilate-boosted Giga Impact.
Strategies built around countering these tactics are also very common. Sturdy is a free Focus Sash for Pokemon to survive any single attack with at least 1 HP. Also, investing a lot in bulk helps, so your Pokemon can survive the initial attack and retaliate with Counter, Mirror Coat, or Metal Burst, which rebound the damage back at the foe for the KO.

Format: AG

Overview: =================
AG (Anything Goes) is a 6v6 singles metagame that has the fewest restrictions found in any of Smogon's formats. Every Pokemon from any tier is allowed, and because the Species Clause is lifted, you can have up to six of the same Pokemon on your team. In fact, all clauses besides Endless Battle are gone, so strategies that are generally deemed uncompetitive such as Moody and Swagger are completely usable here.
You can discuss strategies with friends in the Anything Goes room on the simulator, the Anything Goes Discord.

Endless Battle Clause: Players cannot intentionally prevent their opponent's Pokemon from fainting from PP depletion and Struggle recoil.

Composition
Almost Any Ability (AAA) is an Other Metagame based on OU with one simple change: Pokemon can now use almost any ability! That means that you can give your Buzzwole Tinted Lens or your Tapu Fini Poison Heal. Some abilities are just too strong on any Pokemon, however, so make sure to see the full banlist below.
Play Restrictions

All standard OU clauses and bans apply.
2 Ability Clause: Teams are limited to two of the same ability. This includes variants like Teravolt and Turboblaze.

Imposter

Parental Bond
Protean
Pure Power

Stakeout
Water Bubble
Wonder Guard

Item Restrictions
The following items have been unbanned:

Metagrossite

Basic Strategy
Buzzwole is one of the best Pokemon in AAA. With the ability to run Intimidate on a bulky set to threaten physical attackers and support teammates; Triage with Bulk Up + Leech Life + Drain Punch and either additional recovery in Roost or coverage moves like Ice Punch to go before most faster threats and easily sweep; Tinted Lens to extremely damage if not KO most common switch-ins; or other useful utility abilities like Unaware, Magic Bounce, and Flash Fire to handle opposing setup sweepers for teammates, deflect threatening entry hazards and status moves to prevent teammates from being crippled, and absorb moves for Fire-weak teammates.
An extremely common playstyle in AAA is -ate Speed (an -ate or -ize ability + Extreme Speed). Consisting of Aerilate, Pixilate, Refrigerate, and Galvanize, -ate abilities can be given to Pokemon with access to Extreme Speed in order to grant them newfound coverage on top of powerful priority, which lets them revenge kill fast Pokemon easily. Common users of this tactic include Lucario, Genesect, and Entei.
While -ate Speed might seem broken, a Generation 7 mechanic was introduced to counter this: priority blocking. Notable Pokemon that utilize this mechanic are Minior, Volcarona, and Alakazam. Minior and Volcarona utilize either Queenly Majesty or Dazzling; Minior uses the ability alongside a Focus Sash to ensure it can set up with Shell Smash and not worry about having priority KO it the following turn, whereas Volcarona uses the ability to patch up its lackluster physical bulk in addition to setting up with Quiver Dance. The other form of priority blocking comes in with Psychic Surge. Alakazam is given this ability before it Mega Evolves to cover up its shoddy physical bulk, as well as boosting the power of its STAB moves, which allows it to delay Mega Evolving until it actually needs to KO something bulkier.
In standard play, Tapu Koko lacks access to reliable physical STAB moves, which forces it to run special attacking sets despite having a higher Attack stat. In AAA, however, it can utilize either Pixilate or Galvanize for access to either physical dual STAB coverage or a stronger, recoil-free Electric-type STAB move.
Another common set takes the form of Regenerator + Assault Vest (RegenVest) on bulky Pokemon, like Magearna, Manaphy, and Meloetta, and it allows them to utilize their bulk and wide range of utility moves to safely pivot into teammates that are the most fit for taking care of the foe or pressuring the opponent.

A Note About Pokemon Showdown!
While there is a playable ladder on PS! for the Battle Spot Singles metagame, and our Battle Spot chatroom is a great place to hang out and meet other players, we would like to point out that we are focusing on the official metagame which is playable on the Sun and Moon games themselves. This is due to the fact that the playerbase is considerably smaller on PS! and also lacks the huge influence of the Japanese community. We are certainly not condemning the use of PS!, as it is a great place to try out team ideas before you commit the time to breeding your Pokemon, but make sure you jump on your 3DS to get the full experience!

For instance, if your Lucario has Swords Dance / Close Combat / Crunch / Bullet Punch, it will become a Normal / Fighting type! Hidden Power, Mimic, and other such moves are considered Normal-type moves and will change Pokemon to said type if it is in the first half of the Pokemon's moveslots. Pokemon with multiple moves of the same type in their first two slots will have only one type. For instance, a Lucario with Close Combat / Vacuum Wave / Nasty Plot / Swords Dance will be a mono Fighting-type. Types are instantly revealed in battle upon Pokemon being sent out.

Format: Mix and Mega

Overview: 

Description: Composition
Mix and Mega is an Other Metagame where players can put a Mega Stone or Orb on almost any one of their Pokemon to give it the typing, stats, and ability that the Mega Stone or Orb would give a Mega Evolution, with the limit of one Mega Evolution per team removed. For example, Sablenite Magearna would have Magic Bounce for its ability, and it would get +10 Attack, +50 Defense, +20 Special Attack, +50 Special Defense, and -30 Speed.
Play Restrictions

Mix and Mega follows the standard Uber clauses.
Mega Stone / Orb Clause: A limit of one of each Mega Stone and Orb may be used.

Pokemon Restrictions
The following Pokemon cannot Mega Evolve using non-native Mega Stones:

Arceus
Deoxys
Deoxys-Attack
Deoxys-Speed
Dialga

Item Restrictions

The following Mega Stones cannot be used on non-native holders:

Beedrillite
Blazikenite
Kangaskhanite
Mawilite
Medichamite
Pidgeotite

Move Restrictions
Pokemon cannot use the following moves:

Baton Pass
Electrify

Ability Restrictions
The following abilities are banned:

Shadow Tag

Pokemon may not Mega Evolve with following abilities:

Zygarde with Power Construct

Other Mechanics

You can Mega Evolve all of your Pokemon.
Red Orb and Blue Orb holders will Primal Devolve upon their first time being sent out, just like normal Devolution.
If a Pokemon uses a Mega Stone that gives a secondary typing that is the same as their primary typing, the secondary typing is removed (Red Orb Charizard becomes a pure Fire-type).
Mega Stones and Orbs cannot be knocked off whatsoever.
If a Pokemon changes its forme before Mega Evolving, it will revert to its base forme upon Mega Evolution (Diancite Greninja-Ash will Mega Evolve into a regular Greninja with Diancite's stat boosts).
A Mega Pokemon whose base stats become a value higher than 255 or a value lower than 1 will be capped at 255 and 1, respectively.

Basic Strategy
-ate Speed (Aerilate or Pixilate + Extreme Speed) is undoubtedly one of the most popular playstyles in Mix and Mega. Common users such as Altarianite Zygarde are some of the biggest metagame threats due to their easily high Attack stats and access to Pixilate- and STAB-boosted Extreme Speed.
Another common strategy is -ate spam, with common users being Glalitite Weavile and either Pinsirite or Altarianite Zygarde, giving them all extremely reliable STAB moves to target almost the entire metagame with.

Format: Monotype

Overview: Monotype is a format where all Pokemon on your team must share a common type. Both single- and dual-type Pokemon are allowed. For instance, Gengar is eligible for both mono-Ghost and mono-Poison teams. In the case of a Pokemon that can Mega Evolve, both it and its Mega Evolution must share a type with the rest of the team. For example, Gyarados is a Water / Flying type and may be used on mono-Water or mono-Flying teams, but it may only hold Gyaradosite on a mono-Water team. This is because Mega Gyarados is a Water / Dark type, so it would not share a type with a mono-Flying team. By the same principle, regular Gyarados may not be used on a mono-Dark team even if it is holding Gyaradosite.
This metagame is run by a tiering council. It is a challengeable format on Pokemon Showdown, and you can discuss strategies in the Monotype room on the simulator or in the main thread on the forums.

Format: NFE

Overview: 

Description: Composition
NFE (Not Fully Evolved) is an Other Metagame in which the main premise is simple: only Pokemon that can evolve are allowed.
Play Restrictions

Players must use the standard Smogon-wide Clauses.

Pokemon Restrictions
Players cannot use any Pokemon that cannot evolve.
Additionally, the following Pokemon have been banned from NFE.

Ability Restrictions
Players cannot use the following abilities:

Arena Trap

Shadow Tag

Move Restrictions
Players cannot use the following moves:

Aurora Veil
Baton Pass

Basic Strategy
NFE is a very diverse metagame. Being a metagame with no fully evolved Pokemon, Eviolite is a godsend to the tier. Conversely, Knock Off is a staple move because of how centralizing and common Eviolite is. This, in conjunction with the low power creep present in the tier makes Bulky Offense the most consistent style of play in NFE, and puts bulky set-up sweepers such as Clefairy and Servine at the forefront of the metagame. However, most playstyles, with the exception of Stall, are viable. Hyper Offense in NFE has to reckon with Clefairy cores and Servine cores, but has some strong wall breakers to do so in Haunter, Fraxure, and Frogadier. Other offensive styles of play such as VoltTurn and Spikes Stack exploit the lack of Ground-types and hazard removal within the tier. The former has a particularly strong core in Monferno / Staravia and Electabuzz, which checks common defensive cores such as Clefairy and Mareanie / Ferroseed. Spikes stack, similarly, is played primarily because of how difficult it is for defensive team styles to deal with it. The most prominent Spikes user in NFE is Roselia, who threatens hazard removers such as Servine, Wartortle, Prinplup, and Togekiss with its STAB coverage. Other notable Spikes setters include Mareanie and Ferroseed. Sometimes Spikes Stack Offense is combined with other playstyles that benefit from the chip Spikes provide, such as Bulky Offense and VoltTurn Offense. All in all, NFE is a wide-ranging metagame whose low power creep offers an enjoyable experience for both beginners and competitive players alike.
NFE Forum Resources
The NFE Viability Rankings is a great way to know the current standings of Pokemon within the tier, as well as strategy for each Pokemon, linked inside the viability rankings.
The NFE Sample Teams are a great start for any player looking to get into NFE, with these consistent teams being easy to use and showing the ropes of the tier.
The NFE Role Compendium is an extremely useful tool for teambuilding in NFE, as it carries a complete guide of every viable role for Pokemon in the tier.
The NFE Speed Tiers are a helpful tool for creating more in depth teams, allowing the speed creep wars of the tier to be explored, as well as the general pacing of offensive Pokemon in the tier.

Format: RU

Overview: RU (Rarelyused) is Smogon's third usage-based tier. All Pokemon that are not OU or UU by usage and are not banned to Ubers, UUBL, or RUBL can be used in RU, including Pokemon from NU and PU. While any of the aforementioned Pokemon can be used in RU, only those Pokemon that make up at least ~3.41% of total weighted usage in the tier are designated 'RU.' A Pokemon is truly 'RU' if a typical competitive player is more than 50% likely to encounter that Pokemon at least once in a given day of playing (20 battles). In addition to its subforum and public room on Pokemon Showdown, RU also has a very active discord server.

Description: Play Restrictions

Baton Pass Clause: Baton Pass is banned

Players cannot use the following moves:

non-Transitive Bans

Despite the fact that Drought is banned from UU, Drought is not banned in RU. This is an outdated precedent that is not applicable in more modern generations.
Unless otherwise specified, abilities, items, and moves banned from Uber, OU, UUBL, or UU, are also banned from RU.

Format: Sketchmons

Overview: 

Description: Composition
Sketchmons is an Other Metagame where all Pokemon get access to the move Sketch once, thus being able to learn almost any move once, barring the few that are restricted from being sketched.
Play Restrictions

Sketchmons follows the standard OU clauses and banlist.
Sketch Clause: You can't sketch two of the same moves in a team with non-native users.

Pokemon Restrictions
The following Pokemon cannot be used:

Ash-Greninja
Kartana
Porygon-Z

Move Restrictions
Pokemon cannot sketch the following moves, in addition to already unsketchable moves:

Belly Drum
Celebrate
Chatter
Conversion
Forest's Curse
Geomancy
Happy Hour
Hold Hands
Lovely Kiss
Purify
Quiver Dance
Shell Smash
Shift Gear
Sketch
Spore
Sticky Web
Trick-or-Treat

Other Mechanics

If a move is banned from being sketched, your Pokemon can still use the move if it learns it naturally.
If you sketch a move onto a Pokemon that is on a team with another Pokemon that learns that move naturally, it evades the Sketch clause (Extreme Speed Dragonite + Extreme Speed Mega Pinsir is legal).

Basic Strategy
Filler.

Generation: sm
Format: STABmons

Overview: 

Description: Composition
STABmons is an Other Metagame based on OU with one simple change: Pokemon now learn all moves that match their typing. Eevee, a Normal-type, has access to every Normal move in the game plus all the regular moves it learns naturally. This access to moves continues with evolution, so Espeon, a Psychic-type Pokemon that evolves from Eevee, now learns all Psychic and Normal moves.
Play Restrictions

All standard OU clauses apply, plus:
Generation Jumping, or transferring moves from one generation to the next due to type changes, is not allowed. Togekiss changed from Normal / Flying to Fairy / Flying in XY, but its Normal-type moves do not carry forward.
A Pokemon must be able to learn its new moves outside of battle similar to learning a TM. This means that Mega Pokemon and some formes don't transfer their types backward since they cannot learn TMs outside of battle. For example, Mega Gyarados does not transfer all Dark-type moves to regular Gyarados, and thus Gyarados cannot use any Dark-type moves it doesn't already know.

Pokemon Restrictions

Aerodactyl
Araquanid
Blacephalon
Kartana
Komala
Kyurem-Black
Porygon-Z
Silvally (all formes)
Tapu Koko
Tapu Lele
Thundurus

Item Restrictions

King's Rock
Razor Fang

Move Restrictions
Players may only use these moves on Pokemon that learn them naturally:

Acupressure
Belly Drum
Chatter
Extreme Speed
Geomancy
Lovely Kiss
Shell Smash
Shift Gear
Spore
Thousand Arrows

Basic Strategy
Because a lot of Pokemon can learn powerful new attacks that they previously couldn't use, STABmons is generally a fast-paced metagame. Examples of strong wallbreakers include Water Spout Ash-Greninja, V-create Mega Charizard X, and Boomburst Mega Pidgeot. Additionally, while a lot of setup moves have been banned, setup is still popular, with Dragon Dance Garchomp, Tail Glow Yanmega and Araquanid being prominent threats.
However, many Pokemon also get defensive or utility-based upgrades. For instance, Celesteela can now restore its health with Roost, clear entry hazards with Defog, and burn physical attackers with Beak Blast, and Ferrothorn can restore its health with Strength Sap and trap foes with Anchor Shot. This means that many fatter or more balanced archetypes are still extremely viable.

Format: Tier Shift

Overview: 

Description: Composition
Tier Shift is an Other Metagame where Pokemon gain boosts to all stats except HP depending on the tier that they're in. The stat boosts are as follows:

OU/UUBL: +0
UU/RUBL: +10
RU/NUBL: +20
NU/PUBL: +30
PU/NFE/LC Uber/LC: +40

Play Restrictions

Tier Shift follows the standard OU clauses and banlist.

Item Restrictions
Players cannot use the following items:

Damp Rock
Deep Sea Tooth
Eviolite

Other Restrictions
If a Pokemon from a lower tier uses something banned in that tier or a tier above it (Regice with Aurora Veil), it will get the boosts from the lowest tier without the ban. For example, if Regice with Aurora Veil is used, it will get UU's boosts due to Aurora Veil being banned in RU, NU, and PU.
If a Pokemon has a Mega Evolution in a higher tier and is holding its Mega Stone, it will get the Mega Evolution's boosts. Altaria holding Altarianite will get UU boosts due to Mega Altaria being UU.
If a Pokemon has a stat that goes over 255 after being boosted, the stat gets capped at 255 to match the in-game stat cap.

Generation: sm
Format: Uber

Overview: Ubers is the most inclusive of Smogon's tiers, allowing the use of any Pokemon species. Only abilities and tactics that have been proven to be uncompetitive or excessively strong even among their peers are banned from use.

Description: Play Restrictions
Players must abide by the following clauses:


Species Clause: A player cannot have two Pokemon with the same National Pokédex number on a team.


Sleep Clause: If a player has already put a Pokemon on his/her opponent's side to sleep and it is still sleeping, another one can't be put to sleep.


Evasion Clause: A Pokemon may not have either Double Team or Minimize in its moveset.


OHKO Clause: A Pokemon may not have the moves Fissure, Guillotine, Horn Drill, or Sheer Cold in its moveset.
