Format: 1v1

Overview: 

Description: Composition
1v1 is an Unofficial Metagame in which players choose a Pokemon they believe is capable of defeating most—if not all—other Pokemon in a one-on-one situation. Players are allowed to bring a team of three Pokemon to the team preview but must select only one to battle with. So while your team of three should be able to cover a wide variety of common threats, the Pokemon you send out must be able to beat any of your opponent's Pokemon, or at least the one you think they will use against you.
This metagame is run by Lumii and a council. You can discuss strategies with friends in the 1v1 room on the simulator, the 1v1 Discord, or in the main thread on the forums.

Basic Strategy
Brute strength decides a lot of 1v1 matches, so common threats include Latios, Porygon-Z, Volcarona, and Rhyperior. Abilities that dampen your foe's power like Intimidate and Solid Rock are useful because your Pokemon will take less damage from threatening attacks, giving you a turn to set up or fight back. Landorus-T, Gyarados, and Rhyperior can use this strategy, letting them live powerful attacks and launch devastating blows against unprepared opponents.
Because some matches are typically decided within a single turn, recharge moves that would normally have little viability in a standard metagame actually excel here. Rhyperior's access to the coveted Rock Wrecker will tear apart large swaths of the metagame, and can have its power boosted boosted by the ubiquitous Choice Band. Adaptability aids Porygon-Z in boosting the damage dealt by Hyper Beam, turning it into a monstrous threat any team must prepare for.
Strategies built around countering these tactics are also very common. Sturdy is a free Focus Sash for Pokemon to survive any single attack with at least 1 HP. Also, investing a lot in bulk helps so your Pokemon can survive the initial attack and retaliate with Counter, Mirror Coat, or Metal Burst, which rebound the damage back at the foe for the KO.

Format: DW OU

Overview: 

Description: Composition
The Dream World was Game Freak's method to slowly distribute Pokemon's Hidden Abilities through the hidden grotto feature in the Black and White games. This competitive format was played with the assumption that all Pokemon's Hidden Abilities and all Event Pokemon had been released at the start of the generation. The general philosophy of the format was to unban as many Pokemon as possible from Ubers and to greatly limit bans in general, including those on trapping abilities, Baton Pass, and weather. Many of the assumed Hidden Abilities in this format never were formally released, and some were even changed with the introduction of XY.
The metagame of DW OU largely only existed in the BW1 era; the format was discontinued shortly after the release of BW2 due to lack of playerbase. Because of this, the DW OU metagame was played and analyses were written assuming the breeding and tutor limitations present in BW1, as well as lacking Kyurem-B, Kyurem-W, and Keldeo-Resolute.

Generation: bw
Format: RUBL

Overview: 

Description: Composition
RUBL (RarelyUsed Banlist) is the banlist for RU and is not a playable tier. RUBL Pokemon are not UU by usage (i.e., they do not have above 3.41% usage in UU) but cannot be used in RU.

Pokemon List:



Generation: bw
Format: STABmons

Overview: 

Description: Composition
STABmons is an Other Metagame based on OU with one simple change: Pokemon now learn all moves that match their typing.
Play Restrictions

All standard OU clauses apply, plus:
Prevolution Clause: Pokemon that change type upon evolving can learn all moves of the type of their prevolution. For example:

Eevee, a Normal-type, has access to every Normal-type move in the game plus all the regular moves it learns naturally. This access to moves continues with evolution, so Espeon, a Psychic-type Pokemon that evolves from Eevee, now learns all Psychic- and Normal-type moves.
However, Espeon cannot run Fire-type moves from Flareon because Espeon and Flareon can not interchangeably change between formes.


Forme Transitivity Clause: A Pokemon must be able to learn its new moves outside of battle similar to learning a TM. This means that battle-only formes don't transfer their types backward since they cannot learn TMs outside of battle. For example:

Shaymin gets all Flying-type moves from Shaymin-Sky because it transforms outside of battle with the Gracidea.
Meloetta-Pirouette does not transfer all Fighting-type moves to regular Meloetta, and thus you cannot give Meloetta any Fighting-type moves it doesn't already know.


Limited Normals Clause: Normal-types may only learn one foreign move. For example, Porygon-Z can run Tri Attack and Judgment, but not Hyper Voice and Judgment.

Pokemon Restrictions
The following Ubers Pokemon are unbanned:

Darkrai
Deoxys-Defense
Deoxys-Speed
Landorus
Thundurus
Tornadus-Therian

Move Restrictions
Players may only use these moves on Pokemon that learn them naturally:

Sketch

Basic Strategy
Because a lot of Pokemon can learn powerful new attacks that they previously couldn't use, STABmons is generally a fast-paced metagame. Examples of strong wallbreakers include Water Spout Keldeo, V-create Darmanitan, and Shell Smash Porygon-Z.

Pokemon List:



Generation: bw
Format: Uber

Overview: Ubers is the most inclusive of Smogon's tiers, allowing the use of any Pokemon species. Ubers is not influenced by Pokemon usage in OU, UU, RU, or NU, and the usage of Pokemon in Ubers has no influence on the compositions of those tiers.

Description: Play Restrictions
Players must abide by the following clauses:

Species Clause: A player cannot have two Pokemon with the same National Pokédex number on a team.
Sleep Clause Mod: If a player has already put a Pokemon on their opponent's side to sleep and it is still sleeping, another one can't be put to sleep.
Evasion Clause Players cannot use Double Team or Minimize in any of their Pokemon's movesets.
OHKO Clause: A Pokemon may not have the moves Fissure, Guillotine, Horn Drill, or Sheer Cold in its moveset.
Endless Battle Clause: Players cannot intentionally prevent an opponent from being able to end the game without forfeiting.
Moody Clause: Players may not start a battle with the ability Moody on their team.

Format: UU

Overview: UU (UnderUsed) is Smogon's second usage-based tier. All Pokemon that are not OU by usage and are not banned to Ubers or UUBL can be used in UU, including Pokemon from RU and NU. While any of the aforementioned Pokemon can be used in UU, only those Pokemon that make up at least ~3.41% of total weighted usage in the tier are designated UU. A Pokemon is truly UU if a typical competitive player is more than 50% likely to encounter that Pokemon at least once in a given day of playing (20 battles).

Evasion Clause - Players cannot use Double Team or Minimize in any of their Pokemon's movesets.
OHKO Clause - Players cannot use Horn Drill, Guillotine, Sheer Cold, or Fissure in any of their Pokemon's movesets.
