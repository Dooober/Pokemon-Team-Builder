Format: 1v1

Overview: 1v1 is an Independent Unofficial Metagame where players choose a Pokemon that they believe is capable of defeating most—if not all—other Pokemon in a one-on-one situation. Players are allowed to bring a team of three Pokemon to the team preview but must select only one to battle with. So, while your team of three should be able to cover a wide variety of common threats, the Pokemon you send out must be able to beat any of your opponent's Pokemon, or at least the one you think they will use against you.
This metagame is run by Felucia. It has a permanent ladder on Pokemon Showdown!.

Format: AG

Overview: AG (Anything Goes) is a 6v6 singles metagame that has the fewest restrictions found in any of Smogon's formats. Every Pokemon from any tier is allowed, and because the Species Clause is lifted, you can have up to six of the same Pokemon on your team. In fact, all clauses besides Endless Battle are gone, so strategies that are generally deemed uncompetitive such as Moody and Evasion are completely usable here.
This metagame has a permanent ladder on Pokemon Showdown! under the same name.

Endless Battle Clause: Players cannot intentionally prevent their opponent's Pokemon from fainting from PP depletion and Struggle recoil.

Teambuilding is often a choice between stall, hyper offense, Flower Veil, Imposter, and various other fun pairings.

Overview: National Dex Monotype is a variant of Monotype that mixes in the mechanics and validation of National Dex. In the case of a Pokemon that can Mega Evolve, both it and its Mega Evolution must share a type with the rest of the team. For example, Gyarados is a Water / Flying type. It may be used on mono-Water or mono-Flying teams. However, it may only hold Gyaradosite on a mono-Water team. This is because Mega Gyarados is a Water / Dark type, so it would not share a type with a mono-Flying team. By the same principle, regular Gyarados may not be used on a mono-Dark team even if it is holding Gyaradosite.
This metagame is run by a tiering council. It has a permanent ladder on Pokemon Showdown!, and you can discuss strategies in the National Dex Monotype room on the simulator, in the National Dex Monotype Discord, and the National Dex Monotype Forum.

Description: Play Restrictions
All standard National Dex OU tier clauses apply, plus:

Same Type Clause: All Pokemon in a team must share a type.
Terastal Clause: Terastallization is banned.

Basic Strategy
Eviolite or Eviolite? That is the question. Historically, the NFE metagame has mainly consisted of balance and bulky-offense teams that center around Eviolite, as it increases the bulk of non-fully evolved Pokemon by 50%, and by extension, moves like Knock Off, Thief, Covet, and Trick become very valuable for creating progress. However, other playstyles have also been very successful, with hazard stack and Sticky Web teams being especially notable due to the rarity of Heavy-Duty Boots. All in all, NFE is a wide-ranging metagame with a low power creep that offers an enjoyable experience for both beginners and competitive veterans alike.
NFE Forum Resources
The NFE Viability List is a great way to know the current standings of Pokemon within the tier, as well as strategy for each Pokemon, linked inside the viability rankings.
The NFE Role Compendium is another useful tool for teambuilding in NFE, listing key utility offered by Pokemon and the respective options available in the tier.
The NFE Speed Tiers are a helpful tool for creating more in depth teams, allowing players to more accurately gauge the Speed of meta-relevant threats in the tier, as well as the general pacing of offensive Pokemon in the tier.

Generation: sv
Format: Partners in Crime

Overview: Partners in Crime is a doubles based Other Metagame where both active ally Pokemon share abilities and moves. For example, having both a Gholdengo and Incineroar on the field will give them both access to the abilities Good as Gold and Intimidate, as well as both having access to Fake Out and Recover from their respective movepools. This allows for unique setups and dangerous combinations not seen in a typical doubles match.
This metagame is run by HiZo, Chromate, yuki, and a council. It has a permanent ladder on Pokemon Showdown!. You can discuss strategies with friends in the Other Metas room on the simulator, the Other Metagames Discord, or in the main thread on the forums.

Format: STABmons

Overview: STABmons is an Other Metagame where Pokemon now learn all moves that match their typing. As such, Eevee, a Normal-type, has access to every Normal move in the game plus all the regular moves it learns naturally. This access to moves continues with evolution, so Sylveon, a Fairy-type Pokemon that evolves from Eevee, now learns all Fairy and Normal moves.
This metagame is run by NeonJolteonWasUsed and a council.

Description: Play Restrictions

All standard OU clauses apply, plus:
Sleep Moves Clause: All sleep-inducing status moves, including Yawn, are banned.
Terastal Clause: Players may not Terastallize.
A Pokemon must be able to learn its new moves outside of battle similar to learning a TM. This means that some formes don't transfer their types backward since they cannot learn TMs outside of battle. For example, Galarian Darmanitan-Z does not transfer all Fire-type moves to regular Galarian Darmanitan, and thus Galarian Darmanitan cannot use any Fire-type moves it doesn't already know.

Flower Trick
Gigaton Hammer
No Retreat
Rage Fist
Revival Blessing
Shell Smash
Shift Gear
Triple Arrows
V-create
Victory Dance
Wicked Blow
Wicked Torque

Basic Strategy
Offensive Pokemon are powerful in this metagame, as they can use their new moves to gain more power and break apart defensive cores. Examples include Pokemon such as Iron Valiant with Thunderous Kick and Landorus-Therian with Dragon Ascent. Gyarados can use Dragon Dance, and Dragon Ascent to become a powerful sweeper.
Support Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Great Tusk are also viable, as they have a powerful recovery move in Shore Up; Ting-Lu is also able to pivot out with Parting Shot. Other defensive Pokemon like Toxapex can also work.
Overall, STABmons is an entertaining metagame that creates many new combinations and possibilities!

Generation: sv
Format: Ubers UU

Overview: Ubers UU, or "UUbers", is a unique tier that functions as a usage-based tier beneath Ubers. It is a place for the low-powered legendaries and OUBL Pokemon who are too strong for OU, but too weak for regular Ubers to find play. We the look at the Ubers usage statistics from the previous month, and ban any Pokemon above a 4.52% usage threshold. In this banning process, we do not consider whether the Pokemon is banned or legal in any other tier, meaning that Pokemon usable in UU or even PU might be banned in Ubers UU!
From this starting point, the community and council decide on bans. The Ubers UU council will quickban any blatantly overpowered or uncompetitive Pokemon with a 6/9 (66% or greater) council majority to "Ubers UUBL." For Pokemon which are not as obviously egregious, there will be a suspect test, in which you can ladder up to qualify for the opportunity to vote on the result.
This metagame was founded by KineSquared and is run by Leo Justice and a council. It has a permanent ladder on Pokemon Showdown!.
