Format: 1v1

Overview: 1v1 is an Independent Unofficial Metagame where players choose a Pokemon that they believe is capable of defeating most—if not all—other Pokemon in a one-on-one situation. Players are allowed to bring a team of three Pokemon to the team preview but must select only one to battle with. So, while your team of three should be able to cover a wide variety of common threats, the Pokemon you send out must be able to beat any of your opponent's Pokemon, or at least the one you think they will use against you.
This metagame is run by Mishlef and a council.

Acupressure
Hypnosis

Sing

Basic Strategy
Brute strength decides a lot of 1v1 matches, so common threats on the ladder include Galarian Darmanitan, Haxorus, and Porygon-Z. Abilities that dampen the foe's power like Intimidate are useful because your Pokemon will take less damage from physical attacks, giving your Pokemon a turn to set up or attack. Arcanine and Landorus-Therian can use this strategy.
Because some matches are typically decided within a single turn, recharge moves that would normally have little viability in a standard metagame actually excel here. Primarina's ability Torrent boosts the power of Hydro Cannon to staggering levels, after getting into Torrent's HP range with Endure. Pixilate Sylveon turns Hyper Beam into a blisteringly strong Fairy-type attack.
Strategies built around countering these tactics are also very common. Sturdy is a free Focus Sash for Pokemon to survive any single attack with at least 1 HP, most notably used by Crustle. Also, investing a lot in bulk helps, so your Pokemon can survive the initial attack and retaliate with Counter, Mirror Coat, or Metal Burst, which rebound the damage back at the foe for the KO.

Format: 2v2 Doubles

Overview: 

Description: Composition
2v2 Doubles is a metagame with a plethora of strategies, as it allows players to fully utilize everything Pokemon has to offer, meaning that they can use strategies that are considered niche in singles formats, such as Fake Out and Trick Room. Popular strategies involve the use of Speed control, weather, Trick Room, and more. If you already play 1v1, this metagame is relatively easy to get into since it has a similar concept, and most Pokemon that are viable in 1v1 are very useful here. Putting four 1v1-viable Pokemon onto a team is a good way to start out, and then players can start making changes as needed to face and adapt to the metagame.
This metagame is run by Mubs and a council. You can discuss strategies with friends in the 2v2 room on the simulator, the 2v2 Discord, or in the main thread on the forums.
Play Restrictions

Accuracy Moves Clause: Pokemon cannot use accuracy-lowering moves such as Mud-Slap.
Endless Battle Clause: Players cannot intentionally prevent an opponent from being able to end the game without forfeiting.
Evasion Moves Clause: Players cannot use the moves Double Team or Minimize.
OHKO Clause: Players cannot use the moves Fissure, Guillotine, Horn Drill, or Sheer Cold.
Species Clause: A player cannot have two Pokemon with the same National Pokédex number on a team.
Dynamax Clause: A player cannot Dynamax their Pokemon.
Sleep Clause Mod: A player can only put one of the foe's Pokemon to sleep at a time.

Move Restrictions
Players cannot use the following moves:

Perish Song
Swagger

Basic Strategy
Strategy and brute strength decide a lot of 2v2 Doubles matches, so common threats on the ladder include Naganadel, Cinderace, and Genesect. Abilities that set or utilize weather like Drizzle and Swift Swim are useful because the weather makes the other Pokemon faster, and in the case of rain/sun, also increases the power of the weather utilizer's moves. Fake Out Pokemon such as Zeraora and Incineroar are also common, allowing a powerful partner to avoid one opponent's move on turn 1.

Generation: ss
Format: AG

Overview: AG (Anything Goes) is a 6v6 singles metagame that has the fewest restrictions found in any of Smogon's formats. Every Pokemon from any tier is allowed, and because the Species Clause is lifted, you can have up to six of the same Pokemon on your team. In fact, all clauses besides Endless Battle are gone, so strategies that are generally deemed uncompetitive such as Moody and Swagger are completely usable here.
You can discuss strategies with friends in the Anything Goes room on the simulator, the Anything Goes Discord.

Description: Play Restrictions

Endless Battle Clause: Players cannot intentionally prevent their opponent's Pokemon from fainting from PP depletion and Struggle recoil.

A Note About Pokemon Showdown!
While there is a playable ladder on PS! for the Battle Stadium Singles metagame, and our Battle Stadium chatroom is a great place to hang out and meet other players, we would like to point out that we are focusing on the official metagame which is playable on the Sword and Shield games themselves. This is due to the fact that the playerbase is considerably smaller on PS! and also lacks the huge influence of the Japanese community. We are certainly not condemning the use of PS!, as it is a great place to try out team ideas before you commit the time to breeding your Pokemon, but make sure you jump on your Switch to get the full experience!

Composition
Camomons is an Other Metagame based on OU. However, every Pokemon becomes the types of the first two moves in its moveslots. For instance, if your Lucario has Swords Dance / Close Combat / Crunch / Bullet Punch, it will become a Normal / Fighting type! Mimic and other such moves are considered Normal-type moves and will change Pokemon to said type if it is in the first half of the Pokemon's moveslots. Pokemon with multiple moves of the same type in their first two slots will have only one type. For instance, a Lucario with Close Combat / Vacuum Wave / Nasty Plot / Swords Dance will be a mono Fighting-type. Types are instantly revealed in battle upon Pokemon being sent out.
This metagame is run by The Number Man and a council. It is playable on Pokemon Showdown! You can discuss strategies with friends in the Other Metas room on the simulator or in the main thread on the forums.

Generation: ss
Format: CAP

Overview: 

Description: Composition
Create-A-Pokemon (or simply CAP) is a metagame based on OU that also allows the usage of all 31 of the Pokemon created by the Create-A-Pokemon Project. The addition of CAP Pokemon makes the metagame quite different from OU, although many of the same threats still thrive.
CAP also has a Metagame subforum where resources such as the Metagame Discussion, Viability Rankings, and Sample Teams can be found.
Play Restrictions
Players must abide by the following clauses:

OU clauses.
Necturna Clause: Necturna is restricted to one move learned by Sketch.

Necturna Clause is still in effect in SS because although Necturna cannot use Sketch in this generation, nor can it use Sketch to learn any moves introduced in SS, it can still use Sketch to learn moves in previous generations and then get transferred to this generation.

Generation: ss
Format: Godly Gift

Overview: 

Description: Composition
Godly Gift (GG) is an Other Metagame based on OU, but there's a twist—each team is allowed to have one Uber Pokemon, called a god, with the other five Pokemon being called receivers. Receivers inherit a base stat from the god depending on where on a team they're placed. For example, placing Rotom-W in slot 1 on a team with Yveltal would give Rotom-W a base HP stat of 126.
This metagame is run by Kris and a council. It has a permanent ladder on Pokemon Showdown!. You can discuss strategies with friends in the Other Metas room on the simulator, the Other Metagames Discord, or in the main thread on the forums.

Format: Mix and Mega

Overview: 

Description: Composition
Mix and Mega is an Other Metagame where players can put a Mega Stone on almost any one of their Pokemon to give it the typing, stats, and ability that the Mega Stone would give a Mega Evolution, with the limit of one Mega Evolution per team removed. For example, Sablenite Corviknight would have Magic Bounce for its ability, and it would get +10 Attack, +50 Defense, +20 Special Attack, +50 Special Defense, and -30 Speed.
This metagame is run by Quantum Tesseract and a council. You can discuss strategies with friends in the Other Metas room on the simulator, the Other Metagames Discord, or in the main thread on the forums.
Play Restrictions

Mix and Mega follows the standard Uber clauses.
Mega Stone Clause: A limit of one of each Mega Stone may be used.

Item Restrictions
The following items are banned:

Beedrillite
Blazikenite
Gengarite
Kangaskhanite
Mawilite
Medichamite
Pidgeotite

Other Mechanics

You can Mega Evolve all of your Pokemon.
If a Pokemon uses a Mega Stone that gives a secondary typing that is the same as their primary typing, the secondary typing is removed (Altarianite Togekiss becomes a pure Fairy-type).
Mega Stones cannot be knocked off whatsoever.
If a Pokemon changes its forme before Mega Evolving, it will revert to its base forme upon Mega Evolution (Diancite Eiscue-Noice will Mega Evolve into a regular Eiscue with Diancite's stat boosts).
A Mega Pokemon whose base stats become a value higher than 255 or a value lower than 1 will be capped at 255 and 1, respectively.

Basic Strategy
-ate Speed (Aerilate or Pixilate + Extreme Speed) is undoubtedly one of the most popular playstyles in Mix and Mega. Common users such as Altarianite Entei are some big metagame threats due to their high Attack stats and access to Pixilate- and STAB-boosted Extreme Speed.
Other common threats are Metagrossite Kartana and Lucarionite Zygarde. Their high base Speed, setup moves, and high powered attacks allow them to put huge dents into almost any opposing team.

Overview:

National Dex AG (Anything Goes) is a 6v6 singles metagame that has the fewest restrictions found in any of Smogon's formats. Every Pokemon from any tier is allowed, and because the Species Clause is lifted, you can have up to six of the same Pokemon on your team. Because National Dex AG is a National Dex metagame, all cut Pokemon from past generations, as well as cut moves, Z-Moves, Mega Pokemon, Primal Pokemon and more are legal.
The metagame has a permanent ladder on Pokemon Showdown. You can discuss strategies with friends in the Anything Goes room on the simulator, the Anything Goes Discord, or in the main thread on the forums.

Format: National Dex Monotype

Overview: 

Description: Composition
National Dex Monotype is a variant of Monotype that mixes in the mechanics and validation of National Dex. In the case of a Pokemon that can Mega Evolve, both it and its Mega Evolution must share a type with the rest of the team. For example, Gyarados is a Water / Flying type. It may be used on mono-Water or mono-Flying teams. However, it may only hold Gyaradosite on a mono-Water team. This is because Mega Gyarados is a Water / Dark type, so it would not share a type with a mono-Flying team. By the same principle, regular Gyarados may not be used on a mono-Dark team even if it is holding Gyaradosite.
This metagame is run by maroon, Mateeus, and a tiering council. It has a permanent ladder on Pokemon Showdown!, and you can discuss strategies in the National Dex Monotype room on the simulator, in the National Dex Monotype Discord, and the National Dex Monotype Forum.

Generation: ss
Format: STABmons

Overview: 

Description: Composition
STABmons is an Other Metagame based on OU with one simple change: Pokemon now learn all moves that match their typing. Eevee, a Normal-type, has access to every Normal move in the game plus all the regular moves it learns naturally. This access to moves continues with evolution, so Sylveon, a Fairy-type Pokemon that evolves from Eevee, now learns all Fairy and Normal moves.
This metagame is run by in the hills and a council. You can discuss strategies with friends in the Other Metas room on the simulator or in the main thread on the forums.
Play Restrictions

All standard OU clauses apply, plus:
Sleep Moves Clause: All sleep-inducing status moves, including Yawn, are banned.
Generation Jumping, or transferring moves from one generation to the next due to type changes, is allowed, unlike previous generations. However, it only works for moves that a Pokemon could've gotten in that generation. For example, Clefable can use any Normal-type move introduced in Generation 5 or prior, but it cannot use moves introduced Generation 6 or above, like Boomburst.
A Pokemon must be able to learn its new moves outside of battle similar to learning a TM. This means that some formes don't transfer their types backward since they cannot learn TMs outside of battle. For example, Galarian Darmanitan-Z does not transfer all Fire-type moves to regular Galarian Darmanitan, and thus Galarian Darmanitan cannot use any Fire-type moves it doesn't already know.
