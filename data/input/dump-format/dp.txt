Format: 1v1

Overview: 

Description: Composition
1v1 is an Unofficial Metagame in which players choose a Pokemon they believe is capable of defeating most—if not all—other Pokemon in a one-on-one situation. Players are allowed to bring a team of three Pokemon to the team preview but must select only one to battle with. So while your team of three should be able to cover a wide variety of common threats, the Pokemon you send out must be able to beat any of your opponent's Pokemon, or at least the one you think they will use against you.
This metagame is run by  Euphonos and a council. You can discuss strategies with friends in the 1v1 room on the simulator, the 1v1 Discord, or in the main thread on the forums.

Composition
Create-a-Pokemon (commonly referred to as the CAP Metagame or simply CAP) is a format based on OU that features all Pokemon created by the Create-A-Pokemon Project. The addition of 22 unique Pokemon makes this format quite different from standard OU, though many of OU's top threats still thrive in this format.
To learn more about the CAP Project, check out this guide for newcomers and visit the CAP Project forum. The CAP Metagame has its own subforum where you can discuss the format. CAP has a room on Pokemon Showdown! as well as a Discord where you can discuss anything related to CAP.
