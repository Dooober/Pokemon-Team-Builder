Format: 1v1

Overview: 

Description: Composition
1v1 is an Unofficial Metagame in which players choose a Pokemon they believe is capable of defeating most—if not all—other Pokemon in a one-on-one situation. Players are allowed to bring a team of three Pokemon to the team preview but must select only one to battle with. So while your team of three should be able to cover a wide variety of common threats, the Pokemon you send out must be able to beat any of your opponent's Pokemon, or at least the one you think they will use against you.
This metagame is run by LRXC, Urfgurgle, and a council. You can discuss strategies with friends in the 1v1 room on the simulator, the 1v1 Discord, or in the main thread on the forums.
