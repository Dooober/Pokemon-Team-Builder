Format: 1v1

Overview: 

Description: Composition
1v1 is an Unofficial Metagame where players choose a Pokemon that they believe is capable of defeating most—if not all—other Pokemon in a one-on-one situation. Players are allowed to bring a team of three Pokemon to the team preview but must select only one to battle with. So, while your team of three should be able to cover a wide variety of common threats, the Pokemon you send out must be able to beat any of your opponent's Pokemon, or at least the one you think they will use against you. The metagame is led by Elo Bandit and a council.
You can discuss strategies with friends in the 1v1 room on the simulator or in the RBY Other Metas Hub on the forums.
Play Restrictions

Accuracy Moves Clause: Pokemon cannot use accuracy-lowering moves such as Sand Attack.
Endless Battle Clause: Players cannot intentionally prevent an opponent from being able to end the game without forfeiting.
Evasion Moves Clause: Players cannot use the moves Double Team or Minimize.
Invulnerability Clause: A Pokemon may not have the moves Fly or Dig in its moveset. This is due to a glitch where a Pokemon that becomes fully paralyzed while in a semi-invulnerable state (the second turn of the attack) will remain in that semi-invulnerable state until switching or using Fly or Dig again.
OHKO Clause: Players cannot use the moves Fissure, Guillotine, or Horn Drill.
Sleep Moves Clause: Players cannot use the moves Hypnosis, Lovely Kiss, Sing, Sleep Powder, or Spore.
Species Clause: A player cannot have two Pokemon with the same National Pokédex number on a team.

Pokemon Restrictions
Players cannot use any of the following Pokemon:

Mew
Mewtwo

Move Restrictions
In addition to the move-restricting clauses above, Pokemon may not have the following moves in their moveset:

Format: LC Level 100

Overview: 

Description: Composition
LC Level 100 (Little Cup Level 100) is an Other Metagame that serves as an alternative to standard LC. This format aims to avoid using Tradebacks, which means removing the level cap (and making Pokemon level 100), such that the metagame can be cartridge-legal. All, and only, unevolved Pokemon that are capable of evolution are eligible, which results in allowing Clefairy, a Pokemon that was formerly illegal in standard LC. The legality challenges surrounding obtaining level 5 Pokemon, including Clefairy, with competitive movesets in RBY have since been resolved without the need to introduce Tradebacks, meaning standard LC has established itself as the primary version of the Little Cup metagame.

Generation: rb
Format: LC

Overview: 

Description: Composition
LC (Little Cup) is a format in which players may only use Level 5 Pokemon that have not yet evolved but are capable of evolution.
Due to the lack of breeding in RBY, certain glitches in RBY are allowed to give Pokemon access to their entire level up movepool, as well as permitting the otherwise unobtainable Level 5 Clefairy to be used. RBY moves only obtainable in GSC, such as Ice Punch Abra, are disallowed, as is written in Tradeback Clause.
Play Restrictions
Clauses
Players must abide by the following clauses:

Species Clause - A player cannot have two Pokemon with the same National Pokédex number on a team. For example, you cannot have 2 Koffing on your team.
Evasion Clause - A Pokemon may not have the moves Double Team or Minimize in its moveset.
OHKO Clause - A Pokemon may not have the moves Fissure, Guillotine, or Horn Drill in its moveset.
Endless Battle Clause - In the event of an endless battle (such as only two Dittos remaining who can only transform forever, two Gengar forced to Struggle against each other, etc.), a draw is called.
Cleric Clause - All Pokemon must have full HP and PP, and not have any status conditions prior to the battle. In other words, heal up with Nurse Joy right before your battle if you're on cartridge; the simulators do this automatically.
Invulnerability Clause - A Pokemon may not have the moves Dig or Fly in its moveset. This is due to a glitch where a Pokemon that becomes fully paralyzed while in a semi-invulnerable state (the second turn of the attack) will remain in that semi-invulnerable state until switching or using Fly or Dig again.
Tradeback Clause - Tradeback moves from GSC are not allowed, with the exception of level-up moves already in the Pokemon's learnset.

Mods
Our simulator has implemented these modifications:

Sleep Clause Mod - No more than one Pokemon on each player's side may be sleeping as the direct result of an opponent's move. All effects of moves that would cause sleep are prevented from taking effect while Sleep Clause is active. For cartridge players, you lose if, at the end of your turn, two of your opponent's Pokemon were put to sleep by a move you used, but were not forced into, and neither have had their sleep removed since then.
Freeze Clause Mod - A player cannot freeze two of their opponent's Pokemon at the same time. All effects of moves that would cause freeze are prevented from taking effect while Freeze Clause is active. For cartridge players, a player has the option of requesting a redo or playing it out in the case of receiving multiple freezes.
Desync Clause Mod - If a move would cause a situation that leads to battles desynchronizing during a Link Battle on cartridge, the move will fail. For example, in the event Psywave would deal 0 damage on one side and 1 damage on the other, the move will fail.

Restrictions
The following are not allowed in the format:

The moves Sonic Boom and Dragon Rage are banned due to their ability to OHKO almost everything and everything in the tier, respectively.
The moves Wrap and Fire Spin are banned due to their increased potency at Level 5 and their overcentralizing effects on the metagame.

Format: Middle Cup

Overview: 

Description: Composition
Middle Cup is an Other Metagame not based on any particular tier, but rather formed as its own metagame. The idea of this metagame was that only Pokemon in the middle of an evolutionary line can be used, akin to Little Cup. This meant that Ivysaur may be used because it has a pre-evolution (Bulbasaur) and an evolution (Venusaur), but Shellder can't be used since it doesn't have any pre-evolutions, and Kangaskhan can't be used because it has neither. Because of this, in RBY, only the 16 NFE Pokemon can be used.

All standard clauses from the OU tier apply.

Format: NC 97 Rentals

Overview: 

Description: Composition
NC Cup 97 Rentals is a twist on the take of Nintendo Cup 1997 that the Japanese version of Pokemon Stadium, Pocket Monsters Stadium 2, hosted. This only allows Pokemon from the game's selection of rentals for Nintendo Cup 1997 and Anything Goes. This means that each of the Pokemon below only have 4 possible moves to use. This forces many Pokemon to have less than optimal sets, and several unevolved Pokemon with better movesets to be far more viable than usual.
This format can be played in either a 3v3 or 6v6 style, but the sets will remain the same. The international version of Pocket Monsters Stadium 2, Pokemon Stadium, has a completely different set of rentals. The format for that game can be found here.
Pokemon Stadium has many different mechanics compared to the original RBY games, so reading this article is highly recommended.
Clauses
Players must abide by the following clauses:


Stadium Sleep Clause - A player cannot put two of their opponent's Pokemon to sleep at one time. Run innately by Stadium itself, only it also counts an opposing Pokemon using Rest as well. This doesn't affect its activation, so multiple Pokemon can be resting at one time.


Freeze Clause - A player cannot freeze two of their opponent's Pokemon at the same time.


Level Limit - All rentals are level 50, including Dragonite.


Self-KO Clause - In the event a Pokemon KOes itself with Self-Destruct or Explosion and the use results in a tie, the user automatically loses.


Species Clause - A player cannot have two Pokemon with the same National Pokédex number on a team. For example, you cannot have 2 Koffing on your team.

Poké Cup Rentals is a twist on the International Pokemon Stadium's Poke Cup, only allowing Pokemon from the game's selection of rentals for Poké Cup and Anything Goes. This means that each of the Pokemon below only have 4 possible moves to use, and highly specific Stat Exp investments. This forces many Pokemon to have less than optimal sets, and several unevolved Pokemon with better movesets to be far more viable than usual.
This format can be played in either a 3v3 or 6v6 style, but the sets will remain the same. The Japanese version of Pokemon Stadium, Pocket Monsters Stadium 2, has a completely different set of rentals. The format for that game can be found here.
Pokemon Stadium has many different mechanics compared to the original RBY games, so reading this article is highly recommended.
Clauses
Players must abide by the following clauses:


Stadium Sleep Clause - A player cannot put two of their opponent's Pokemon to sleep at one time. Run innately by Stadium itself, only it also counts an opposing Pokemon using Rest as well. This doesn't affect its activation, so multiple Pokemon can be resting at one time.


Freeze Clause - A player cannot freeze two of their opponent's Pokemon at the same time.


Level Limit - All rentals are level 50, including Dragonite.


Self-KO Clause - In the event a Pokemon KOes itself with Self-Destruct or Explosion and the use results in a tie, the user automatically loses.


Species Clause - A player cannot have two Pokemon with the same National Pokédex number on a team. For example, you cannot have 2 Koffing on your team.

Format: Poke Cup

Overview: 

Description: Composition
Poké Cup is a port of Nintendo Cup 1997 for Pokemon Stadium. The metagame allows you to select 3 out of your 6 Pokemon to send into battle, with Pokemon between levels 50-55. The three Pokemon entered cannot have a combined level exceeding 155, leaving 5 levels to be distributed among the team. Because of the large changes in mechanics, being released after Pokemon Yellow, and ruling changes, the metagame is often treated as a separate entity. To be accurate how it was originally played, tradebacks are normally banned.

Cleric Clause - All Pokemon must have full HP and PP, and not have any status conditions prior to the battle.
Invulnerability Clause - A Pokemon may not have the moves Fly or Dig in its moveset.

Tradeback Clause - Tradeback moves from GSC are not allowed.

Mods
Our simulator has implemented these modifications:

Format: STABmons

Overview: 

Description: Composition
STABmons is an Other Metagame based on OU with one simple change: Pokemon now learn all moves that match their typing. Eevee, a Normal-type, has access to every Normal move in the game plus all the regular moves it learns naturally. This access to moves continues with evolution, so Jolteon, an Electric-type Pokemon that evolves from Eevee, now learns all Electric and Normal moves.
This metagame is led by in the hills and Volk. You can discuss strategies with friends in the Other Metas room on the simulator or in the main thread on the forums. The RBY Other Metas Hub also contains several resources.

Overview: 

Description: Composition
UUBL (UnderUsed Banlist) is the banlist for UU and not a playable tier. Originally determined by community consensus, UUBL was produced for Pokém that can be considered "Borderline Standard" (Standard being the old name for "OU"). These were Pokém usable in OU, but not standard. This UUBL was abolished by Hipmonlee in 2011.
In 2022, UUBL was reinstated for Lapras and Slowbro, which were deemed too powerful for UU and banned by council vote. Slowbro has since returned to OU. Lapras was later made legal in UU, though it and Hypno were banned after a suspect test.
