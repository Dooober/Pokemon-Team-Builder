This ability grants the Pokémon immunity to Electric-type attacks, preventing any damage from such moves. Additionally, when a Pokémon with the Lightning Rod ability is hit by an Electric-type move, its Special Attack is raised by one stage, enhancing its offensive capabilities. This ability is particularly relevant for Ground-type Pokémon, as it not only protects them from Electric-type damage but also boosts their Special Attack, making them more formidable in battle. Overall, Lightning Rod serves as a strategic advantage in Pokémon battles by redirecting Electric-type moves and amplifying the Pokémon's power.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744472058, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44added55e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 132, "prompt_tokens": 396, "total_tokens": 528, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
