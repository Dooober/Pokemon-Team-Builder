It inflicts damage equal to 1/4 of the target's maximum HP per turn while the target remains asleep. This move is classified as non-damaging in nature, meaning it does not deal damage in the traditional sense but rather causes a gradual loss of health over time. Nightmare has an accuracy of 100%, ensuring that it will always hit its target if the conditions are met.
