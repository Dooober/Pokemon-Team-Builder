Specifically, it increases the Pokémon's Attack by 1.5 times when it is affected by a status condition, such as paralysis, poison, or sleep. Notably, Guts also ignores the damage reduction that typically occurs from burn status, allowing the Pokémon to maintain its full attacking potential despite being burned. This ability is particularly associated with the Pokémon Flareon, among others, and is a strategic asset in battles, as it allows Pokémon with Guts to capitalize on status effects to boost their damage output. Overall, Guts is a powerful ability that encourages aggressive playstyles by rewarding players for utilizing status conditions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744472085, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44added55e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 140, "prompt_tokens": 387, "total_tokens": 527, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
