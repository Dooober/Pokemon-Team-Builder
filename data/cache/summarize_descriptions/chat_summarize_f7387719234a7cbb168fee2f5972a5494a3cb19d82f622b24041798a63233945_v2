Specifically, it prevents the Pokémon from being infatuated or taunted, ensuring that it remains unaffected by these status conditions. Additionally, Oblivious grants immunity to the Intimidate ability, which can lower the Attack stat of opposing Pokémon. If a Pokémon gains the Oblivious ability while already infatuated, it will cure the infatuation, allowing it to function normally in battle. This ability is often associated with Normal-type Pokémon, such as Lickitung, and offers a tactical advantage by safeguarding the Pokémon from certain disruptive moves. Overall, Oblivious is a valuable ability that enhances a Pokémon's resilience in competitive play.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744471465, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44added55e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 145, "prompt_tokens": 456, "total_tokens": 601, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
