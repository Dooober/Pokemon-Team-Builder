As a Pokémon type, Steel is recognized for its high defense and resistance to various attacks, making it a formidable choice in competitive play. Steel-type Pokémon, such as Beldum, Metang, Metagross, Empoleon, Magnemite, Magneton, and Genesect, are known for their durability and unique abilities, often associated with metal and machinery.\n\nOne of the defining characteristics of Steel-type Pokémon is their immunity to poison, with the exception of being affected by Pokémon with the Corrosion Ability. Additionally, they are immune to damage from Sandstorm, further enhancing their defensive capabilities. Steel-type Pokémon also possess specific effectiveness against other types, notably having a 2x effectiveness against Fairy types, as well as being strong against Ice and Rock types.\n\nIn terms of moves, Steel-type attacks include various techniques that utilize steel properties, such as Meteor Mash. These moves can deal significant damage and may have additional effects related to durability or defense. Steel moves are particularly effective against Fairy, Ice, and Rock types, and they often involve high power and unique effects in battles.\n\nOverall, Steel represents a robust classification within the Pokémon world, characterized by its defensive strengths, elemental abilities, and the unique attributes of the Pokémon and moves associated with it.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744477555, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44added55e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 273, "prompt_tokens": 1417, "total_tokens": 1690, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
