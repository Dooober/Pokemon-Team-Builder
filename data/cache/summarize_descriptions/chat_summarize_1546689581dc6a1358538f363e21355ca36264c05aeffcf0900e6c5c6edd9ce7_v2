Specifically, it halves the power of Fire-type moves directed at the Pokémon, effectively reducing the damage taken from such attacks by 50%. Additionally, Heatproof also mitigates burn damage, reducing it by half. This ability is particularly beneficial for Pokémon facing opponents that utilize Fire-type moves, allowing them to withstand these attacks more effectively. Overall, Heatproof serves as a defensive mechanism that provides substantial protection against Fire-type damage.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744472994, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44added55e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 103, "prompt_tokens": 277, "total_tokens": 380, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
