Its power is determined by the Z-Power of the base move it is derived from, indicating that it does not have a fixed power value. The move has a power of 1 and an accuracy of 0, suggesting that it may not hit reliably. Additionally, Black Hole Eclipse is classified as a physical move, further defining its usage in battles.
