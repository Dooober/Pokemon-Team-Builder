This nature enhances the physical resilience of Pokémon, making them better suited to withstand physical attacks, but at the cost of their ability to resist special attacks. The Lax nature is particularly noted for its effect on the Pokémon ZUBL, where it similarly boosts Defense while reducing Special Defense.
