This move is categorized as non-damaging, with a power and accuracy of 0, meaning it does not deal damage directly to opponents. The primary function of Substitute is to absorb damage and effects from opponents, effectively providing a buffer against attacks. Additionally, it serves as a flag indicating that certain defensive moves can be bypassed.
