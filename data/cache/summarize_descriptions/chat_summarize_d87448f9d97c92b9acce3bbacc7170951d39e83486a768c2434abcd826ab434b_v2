It effectively lowers the Power Points (PP) of that move by 4, thereby limiting the opponent's options in battle. The move has an accuracy of 100%, ensuring that it will successfully affect the target when used. While some descriptions mention a range of 2-5 PP reduction, the primary and consistent effect of Spite is to reduce the PP of the target's last move by 4.
