This means that when a Pokémon with the Prankster ability uses a status move, it will act before other moves in battle, allowing for strategic advantages. However, it is important to note that Dark-type Pokémon are immune to the effects of this ability, meaning they are not affected by the increased priority granted by Prankster.
