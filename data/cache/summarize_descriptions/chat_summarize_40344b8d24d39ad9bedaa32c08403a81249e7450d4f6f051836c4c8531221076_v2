This ability allows Pokémon to eat held Berries earlier than normal, providing them with strategic advantages during battles. By allowing the consumption of items at 1/2 max HP, Gluttony enhances a Pokémon's performance in combat, as it can utilize healing or beneficial effects from Berries sooner than typically permitted.
