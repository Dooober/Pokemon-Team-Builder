The move has an accuracy of 30%, meaning it has a relatively low chance of hitting. Fissure can only successfully execute this knockout if the user is at a higher level than the target; if the user is at a lower level, the move will fail. Despite its ability to deal a significant amount of damage, specifically noted as 65535 in some descriptions, the move's effectiveness is heavily dependent on the user's level relative to the target's speed and level. Overall, Fissure is characterized by its high-risk, high-reward nature, making it a powerful but situational move in battle.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744474641, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44added55e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 158, "prompt_tokens": 436, "total_tokens": 594, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
