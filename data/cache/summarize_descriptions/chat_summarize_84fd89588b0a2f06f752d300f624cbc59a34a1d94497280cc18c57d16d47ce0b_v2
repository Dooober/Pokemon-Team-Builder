Specifically, Unburden doubles a Pokémon's Speed when it loses its held item. However, this speed boost is temporary; it is lost if the Pokémon switches out or acquires a new item or Ability. This ability is particularly relevant for Fighting-type Pokémon, such as Hitmonlee, as it allows them to capitalize on their speed advantage after consuming their held item. Overall, Unburden serves as a strategic element in battles, enabling Pokémon to gain a competitive edge through increased speed.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744473089, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44added55e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 119, "prompt_tokens": 315, "total_tokens": 434, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
