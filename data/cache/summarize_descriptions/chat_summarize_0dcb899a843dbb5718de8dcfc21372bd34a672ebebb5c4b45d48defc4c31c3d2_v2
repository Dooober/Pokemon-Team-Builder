Surf targets all adjacent Pokémon and is notable for its ability to deal double damage when used after the move Dive. This characteristic makes it particularly effective in battles, as it can hit multiple foes simultaneously while maximizing damage output. Despite some variations in the reported power, Surf consistently maintains its classification as a special move with no additional effects beyond its damage capabilities.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744474509, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44added55e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 125, "prompt_tokens": 390, "total_tokens": 515, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
