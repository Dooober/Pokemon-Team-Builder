Specifically, the power of Reversal escalates the lower the user's remaining health becomes, making it a strategic option in desperate battle situations. Despite its initial power being listed as 0, the move's effectiveness is contingent upon the user's current HP, allowing it to potentially deliver significant damage when the user is low on health.
