Specifically, it boosts the power of Grass-type moves by 1.5 times when the Pokémon's HP is at or below one-third of its maximum health. This ability is particularly notable for its strategic advantage, as it allows Pokémon like Venusaur-Gmax, Snivy, Servine, and Serperior to significantly increase their attack power when they are in a vulnerable state. Overall, Overgrow is a key ability that enhances the effectiveness of Grass-type attacks during critical moments in battle, making it a valuable asset for Pokémon that possess it.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744473309, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44added55e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 130, "prompt_tokens": 579, "total_tokens": 709, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
