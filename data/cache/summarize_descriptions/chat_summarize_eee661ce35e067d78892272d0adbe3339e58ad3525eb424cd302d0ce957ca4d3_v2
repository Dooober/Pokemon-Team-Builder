When activated, Storm Drain raises the Pokémon's Special Attack by 1 stage, enhancing its offensive capabilities. This ability is particularly advantageous in battles, as it not only protects the Pokémon from Water-type attacks but also allows it to capitalize on the situation by boosting its Special Attack. Storm Drain applies to single-target Water moves, ensuring that the Pokémon can absorb these attacks while simultaneously increasing its power.
