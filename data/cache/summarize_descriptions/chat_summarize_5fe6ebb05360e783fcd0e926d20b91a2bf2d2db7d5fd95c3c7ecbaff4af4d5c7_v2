There are some variations in the descriptions regarding the amount of HP restored; however, the most consistent information indicates that it restores 1/8 of max HP at 1/2 max HP or less. It is important to note that the confusion effect is contingent upon the holder having a -SpA Nature. Overall, the Wiki Berry serves as a strategic item for Pokémon that may benefit from HP restoration while also potentially hindering their performance due to confusion.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744475465, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_64e0ac9789", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 168, "prompt_tokens": 484, "total_tokens": 652, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
