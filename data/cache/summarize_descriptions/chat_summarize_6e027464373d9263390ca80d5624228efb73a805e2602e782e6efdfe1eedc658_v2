It allows a Pokémon to heal by 1/4 of its maximum health when hit by Water-type moves and by 1/8 of its health in rainy weather conditions. However, this ability also has drawbacks, as it increases the damage taken from Fire-type attacks by 1.25 times and from sunlight conditions by 1/8. Overall, Dry Skin enhances a Pokémon's survivability in rainy environments while making it more vulnerable to fire-related moves.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744472975, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44added55e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 107, "prompt_tokens": 274, "total_tokens": 381, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
