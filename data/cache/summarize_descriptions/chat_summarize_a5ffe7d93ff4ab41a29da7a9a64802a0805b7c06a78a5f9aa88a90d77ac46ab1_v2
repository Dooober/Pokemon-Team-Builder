This move is characterized as a non-damaging action that raises the user's Attack and Special Attack stats. Under normal conditions, Growth increases these stats by 1 stage. However, in sunny weather conditions, the effectiveness of the move is enhanced, allowing it to raise the user's Attack and Special Attack by 2 stages instead. Additionally, Growth is noted for its ability to raise the user's Special stat by 1 stage, further emphasizing its role in boosting the user's offensive capabilities in battle. Overall, Growth is a strategic move that can significantly enhance a user's performance when used effectively.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744473529, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44added55e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 137, "prompt_tokens": 287, "total_tokens": 424, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
