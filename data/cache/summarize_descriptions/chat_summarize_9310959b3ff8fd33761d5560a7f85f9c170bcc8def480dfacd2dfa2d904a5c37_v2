It is known for its significant damage potential and is associated with various Pokémon, including Porygon. The move is classified as a special attack, but some descriptions also refer to it as a physical move, which may indicate a misunderstanding or variation in its classification in different contexts. Regardless, Hyper Beam requires the user to recharge on the next turn after its use, meaning the user cannot move during that turn. This recharge requirement applies even if the target is not knocked out, emphasizing the strategic consideration needed when using this move in battle.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744474866, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44added55e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 134, "prompt_tokens": 399, "total_tokens": 533, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
