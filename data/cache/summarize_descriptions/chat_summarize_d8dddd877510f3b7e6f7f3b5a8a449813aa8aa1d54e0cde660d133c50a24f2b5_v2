Specifically, it increases the Pokémon's evasion by 1.25 times, which translates to a 20% increase in evasion. Additionally, Sand Veil grants immunity to Sandstorm effects, providing a significant tactical advantage in battles that take place in such weather conditions. This ability is particularly associated with Pokémon like Diglett and its Alolan form. Overall, Sand Veil serves as a defensive mechanism, allowing Pokémon to evade attacks more effectively while benefiting from the protective aspects of Sandstorm.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744473073, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44added55e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 119, "prompt_tokens": 469, "total_tokens": 588, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
