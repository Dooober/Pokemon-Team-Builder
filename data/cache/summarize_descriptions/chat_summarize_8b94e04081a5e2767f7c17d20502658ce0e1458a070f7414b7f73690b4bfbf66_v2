It has an accuracy of 30%, meaning it has a relatively low chance of hitting successfully. The move is characterized by its unique mechanic where it can deal a significant amount of damage, specifically noted as 65535, but it will fail if the target is faster or if the user is at a lower level than the target. Overall, Horn Drill is primarily utilized in competitive contexts due to its potential for an instant knockout, although its effectiveness is heavily dependent on the level comparison between the user and the target.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744474648, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44added55e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 137, "prompt_tokens": 466, "total_tokens": 603, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
