This Mega Evolution grants it the ability Pixilate, which boosts the power of its Fairy-type moves, further diversifying its combat potential.\n\nDespite some descriptions mentioning Altaria as a Normal and Flying type, the consensus is that it is primarily a Dragon and Flying type, especially in its standard form.
