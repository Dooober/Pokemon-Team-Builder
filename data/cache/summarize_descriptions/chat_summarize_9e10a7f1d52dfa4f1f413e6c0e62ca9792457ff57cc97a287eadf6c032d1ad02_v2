Specifically, it prevents the successful execution of the Copycat move under certain circumstances. This condition arises when Copycat is the last move used by any Pokémon, resulting in its failure. Additionally, Fail Copycat serves as a flag indicating that a move cannot be copied by Copycat if it has failed previously. This limitation impacts battle strategies, as it restricts the ability to utilize the Copycat move effectively in various scenarios.
