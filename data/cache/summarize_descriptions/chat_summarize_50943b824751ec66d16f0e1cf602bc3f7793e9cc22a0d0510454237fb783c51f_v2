It allows a Pokémon to survive one hit with at least 1 HP if it is at full health, making it immune to one-hit knockout (OHKO) moves. This ability ensures that certain Pokémon, such as Roggenrola and Boldore, cannot be knocked out in a single attack, effectively enhancing their survivability in combat. Sturdy not only enables these Pokémon to withstand powerful hits but also causes OHKO moves to fail against them, further solidifying their defensive capabilities. Overall, Sturdy is a crucial ability for Pokémon that rely on durability in battle scenarios.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744472109, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44added55e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 129, "prompt_tokens": 396, "total_tokens": 525, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
