It is characterized by its ability to strike multiple times, hitting 2 to 5 times in a single turn. The move has a power of 15 and boasts an accuracy of 100%, making it a reliable choice in battles. Water Shuriken is notable for usually going first in the turn order, allowing Greninja to gain a strategic advantage. Additionally, when Greninja is in its Ash-Greninja form, the effectiveness of Water Shuriken is enhanced, further increasing its utility in combat. Despite some descriptions categorizing Water Shuriken as a special move, it is primarily recognized as a physical Water-type attack.
