It has a base power of 130 and an accuracy of 90%. However, if the user misses the attack, it suffers significant consequences, taking damage equivalent to 50% of its maximum HP. Some descriptions also mention a lower power of 85 and a different damage penalty of 1/8 of the user's HP if it misses, but the most consistent and widely accepted details highlight the move's power as 130 and the severe penalty of 50% max HP damage upon a miss.
