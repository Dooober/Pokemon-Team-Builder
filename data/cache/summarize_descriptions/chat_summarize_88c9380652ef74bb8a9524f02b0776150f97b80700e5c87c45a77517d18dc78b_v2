It is categorized as a physical attack with a power of 0, meaning it does not have a base power value but instead relies solely on the user's level for damage calculation. Seismic Toss boasts an accuracy of 100%, ensuring that it will hit its target without fail. Additionally, this move is capable of hitting Ghost-type Pokémon, which are typically immune to many other physical attacks.
