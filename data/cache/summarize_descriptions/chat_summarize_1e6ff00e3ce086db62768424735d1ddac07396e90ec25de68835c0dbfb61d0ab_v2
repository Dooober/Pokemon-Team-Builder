When a Pokémon with the Synchronize ability is affected by a status condition such as burn, poison, or paralysis, the opponent who inflicted that condition will also receive the same status condition. This ability effectively passes on the inflicted status to the opponent, creating a strategic advantage in battles by retaliating against the opponent's actions.
