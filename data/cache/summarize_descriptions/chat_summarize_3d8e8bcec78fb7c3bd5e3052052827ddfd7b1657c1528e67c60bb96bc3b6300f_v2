Specifically, Gyro Ball deals more damage when the user is slower than the target, with its power increasing the greater the speed difference in favor of the target. This move boasts an accuracy of 100, making it a reliable choice in competitive scenarios. Overall, Gyro Ball is characterized by its unique mechanic that rewards slower users with greater damage output against faster opponents.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744474154, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44added55e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 108, "prompt_tokens": 277, "total_tokens": 385, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
