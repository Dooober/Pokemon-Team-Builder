This restriction means that certain moves cannot be selected by Sleep Talk, which typically allows a Pokémon to use a move even while in a sleeping state. The No Sleep Talk flag affects battle dynamics by preventing the user from utilizing Sleep Talk under certain conditions, thereby influencing battle strategy. It is categorized under various flags, including Metronome and Protect, and serves as a limitation on the actions a Pokémon can take while asleep.
