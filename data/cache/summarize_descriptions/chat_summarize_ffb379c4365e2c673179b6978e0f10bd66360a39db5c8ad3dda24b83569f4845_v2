Specifically, Simple doubles the amount by which a Pokémon's stat stages are raised or lowered, effectively amplifying the impact of any stat modifications during calculations. This ability is applicable to certain Pokémon, including Woobat and Swoobat, allowing them to benefit from increased stat changes more than other Pokémon without this ability. Overall, Simple serves as a powerful tool for enhancing a Pokémon's capabilities in battles by maximizing the effects of stat alterations.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744472073, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44added55e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 115, "prompt_tokens": 266, "total_tokens": 381, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
