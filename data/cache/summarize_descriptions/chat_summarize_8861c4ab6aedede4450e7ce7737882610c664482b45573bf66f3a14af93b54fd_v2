Normal moves can be effectively utilized alongside Poison moves, allowing players to develop diverse attack strategies. Poison moves, while categorized as a type of move, can also be classified under Normal actions due to their ability to inflict status effects on opponents. Furthermore, Poison-type moves have the capability to affect Normal-type Pokémon, thereby establishing a significant relationship between these two types.
