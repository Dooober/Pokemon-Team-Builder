Specifically, it applies this flinch chance to attacks that typically do not have a chance to cause flinching. This means that any attack made by the holder that would normally not result in a flinch now has a 10% chance to do so, thereby increasing the strategic options available in combat. Overall, King's Rock serves as a valuable tool for enhancing the effectiveness of the holder's offensive capabilities.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744475188, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44added55e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 108, "prompt_tokens": 278, "total_tokens": 386, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
