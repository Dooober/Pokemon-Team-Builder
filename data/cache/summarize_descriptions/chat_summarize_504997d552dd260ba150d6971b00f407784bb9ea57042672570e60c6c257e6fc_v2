This classification affects the legality and usage of Pokémon and their moves in various battle formats. Specifically, ISNONSTANDARD assesses whether a Pokémon or move adheres to the standard rules of gameplay or if it falls into a nonstandard category, which may include unique conditions or exceptions. The implications of being classified as nonstandard can significantly influence a Pokémon's viability in competitive battles, as it may restrict the Pokémon's usage in certain formats or tournaments. Overall, ISNONSTANDARD serves as a critical flag within the game's mechanics, guiding players in understanding the competitive status of Pokémon and their associated moves.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744474346, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44added55e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 150, "prompt_tokens": 561, "total_tokens": 711, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
