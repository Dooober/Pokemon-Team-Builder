Specifically, Stench provides a 10% increase in the chance of flinching for such attacks. This ability is associated with certain Pokémon and can create a slight advantage in battles by potentially causing opponents to flinch when they make contact. However, it is noted that Stench has limited competitive use, as its effectiveness is primarily situational and relies on the nature of the attacks being used.
