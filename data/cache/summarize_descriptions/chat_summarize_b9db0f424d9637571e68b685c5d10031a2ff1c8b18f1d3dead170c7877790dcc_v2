Specifically, if Darmanitan's HP is above half of its maximum at the end of the turn, it transitions to its Standard Mode. Conversely, if its HP is at or below half, it shifts into Zen Mode. This ability not only changes Darmanitan's appearance but also affects its stats, enhancing its performance in battles under these specific conditions.
