It includes various Pokémon known for their stealth, cunning, and trickery in battles, such as Cacturne, Carvanha, Sharpedo, and Sandile. Dark-type Pokémon possess unique elemental abilities and characteristics that influence their effectiveness in combat, particularly against other types. For instance, Dark-type moves are effective against Psychic and Ghost types, while Dark-type Pokémon are weak against Fighting-type moves.\n\nIn terms of gameplay mechanics, Dark-type Pokémon can be affected by Psychic-type attacks if they are under the effect of Miracle Eye. Additionally, they are immune to Status moves used by Pokémon with the Prankster Ability, unless the Prankster is an ally. Dark-type moves often involve stealth or underhanded tactics, and they can inflict various effects, such as causing flinching, lowering the target's Special Defense, or preventing the target from using the same move twice.\n\nDark-type moves are categorized as Physical and typically have a power of 70 with 100% accuracy. They include attacks like Pursuit and Memento, which are associated with shadowy effects and can have unique interactions with opponents. Overall, the Dark type in Pokémon represents a strategic choice in battles, utilizing elements of stealth and trickery to gain an advantage over opponents.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744477626, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44added55e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 271, "prompt_tokens": 1708, "total_tokens": 1979, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
