This move is unique in that its damage output is contingent upon the user's speed in comparison to the target's speed. Specifically, the faster the user is relative to the target, the more damage Electro Ball inflicts. The move has an initial power of 0, but this power increases based on the user's speed advantage. Additionally, Electro Ball boasts an accuracy of 100, ensuring that it hits its target reliably.
