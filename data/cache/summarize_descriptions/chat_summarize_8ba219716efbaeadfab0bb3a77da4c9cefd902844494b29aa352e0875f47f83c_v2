It is characterized as a flag indicating that a move requires a turn to charge before it can be executed. Specifically, \"Charge\" is a non-damaging Electric-type move that prepares the user for a more powerful attack on the next turn. During this charging turn, the user is prevented from making any other moves. \n\nThe primary effects of \"Charge\" include raising the user's Special Defense by 1 stage and doubling the power of the user's next Electric move. Although it does not deal damage itself, it is categorized under Electric type with a power of 0 and an accuracy of 0. Additionally, \"Charge\" has a high critical hit ratio and is classified as a physical attack with a power of 70 and an accuracy of 100, although this aspect may refer to its potential when combined with subsequent Electric moves.\n\nIn summary, \"Charge\" is a strategic move that enhances the user's defenses while setting up for a more powerful Electric attack in the following turn.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744473431, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44added55e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 210, "prompt_tokens": 456, "total_tokens": 666, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
