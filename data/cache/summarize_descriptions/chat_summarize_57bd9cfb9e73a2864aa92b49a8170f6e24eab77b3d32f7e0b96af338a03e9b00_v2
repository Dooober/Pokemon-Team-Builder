Specifically, Defog reduces the target's evasion, making it easier for the user's attacks to hit. Additionally, it removes hazards and terrain effects from both the user's and the opponent's side of the field, as well as clearing screens on the target's side. Defog is categorized as a Flying-type move, with a Power of 0 and a Priority of 0, indicating that it does not deal damage but plays a strategic role in battle by enhancing the user's chances of landing hits and maintaining a clear battlefield.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744473470, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44added55e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 137, "prompt_tokens": 302, "total_tokens": 439, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
