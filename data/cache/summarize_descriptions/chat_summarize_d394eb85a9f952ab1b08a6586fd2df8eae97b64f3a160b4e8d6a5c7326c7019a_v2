It is designed to restore a portion of the holder's maximum HP when their HP is critically low. Specifically, Iapapa Berry restores 1/3 of the holder's maximum HP when their HP is at 1/4 or less. Additionally, it has a secondary effect that can confuse the holder if they possess a negative Defense nature. There are some variations in the descriptions regarding the amount of HP restored; one description mentions a restoration of 1/8 of the maximum HP when the holder's HP is at 1/2 or less, while another states that it can restore half of the maximum HP at a quarter or less. However, the most consistent information indicates that the primary restoration effect is 1/3 of the maximum HP at 1/4 or less HP.
