It has the primary effects of negating Ground immunities and increasing the accuracy of all moves by 1.67 times. During its effect, Gravity prevents the execution or selection of certain moves, specifically those that rely on Flying-type mechanics, such as Fly and Bounce. This non-damaging move not only enhances the effectiveness of various attacks but also strategically limits the options available to opponents, making it a powerful tool in battle.
