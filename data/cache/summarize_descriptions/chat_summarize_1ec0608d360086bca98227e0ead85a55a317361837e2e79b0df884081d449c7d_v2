Specifically, it causes the target of a foe's move to lose one additional Power Point (PP) for that move. This means that when a Pokémon with the Pressure ability is targeted, the opponent's move will consume more PP than usual, thereby increasing the challenge for the opponent in managing their available moves. Overall, Pressure serves as a strategic advantage by forcing foes to be more mindful of their move usage, as it leads to a quicker depletion of their resources.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744473135, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44added55e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 109, "prompt_tokens": 298, "total_tokens": 407, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
