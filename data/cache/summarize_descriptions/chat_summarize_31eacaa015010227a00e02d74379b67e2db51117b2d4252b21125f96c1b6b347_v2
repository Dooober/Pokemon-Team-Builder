This mechanic adds a strategic layer to battles, as players can utilize moves that are categorized as reflectable to counter their opponents' actions.\n\nReflectable moves can be bounced back to the original user through specific abilities or items, such as Magic Coat or the Magic Bounce Ability. These moves are often non-damaging, with an accuracy of 100 and a power of 0, and they can alter the effects of the original move when reflected. The term also encompasses moves that can be redirected or countered, indicating a dynamic interaction within the gameplay.\n\nOverall, \"REFLECTABLE\" serves as a flag that signifies the potential for moves to be reflected back at the user or opponent, influencing the strategy and outcomes of battles in the Pokémon universe.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744473347, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44added55e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 191, "prompt_tokens": 807, "total_tokens": 998, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
