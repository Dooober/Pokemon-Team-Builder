It is designed to restore a fraction of the holder's maximum HP when the holder's HP is at critical levels. Specifically, it restores 1/3 of the maximum HP when the holder is at 1/4 max HP or less, and it can also confuse the holder if it has a negative Attack nature (-Atk). Additionally, there are variations in its restorative capabilities, with some descriptions indicating it restores 1/8 of max HP when the holder's HP is at 1/2 max HP or less, and another stating it restores 1/2 of max HP at 1/4 max HP or less. Despite these discrepancies, the consistent feature across all descriptions is that Figy Berry can confuse the holder if it possesses a -Atk nature. Overall, Figy Berry is a versatile item that can provide significant healing under specific conditions while also introducing a potential status effect.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744475116, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44added55e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 201, "prompt_tokens": 317, "total_tokens": 518, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
