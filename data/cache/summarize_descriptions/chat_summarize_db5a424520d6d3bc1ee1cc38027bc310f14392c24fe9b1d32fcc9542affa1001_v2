Ghost-type Pokémon are characterized by their spectral nature and abilities related to haunting, deception, and evasion in battles. They include various species such as Litwick, Lampent, and Chandelure, which exhibit unique elemental abilities and characteristics.\n\nIn terms of battle mechanics, Ghost-type Pokémon have specific interactions with other types, being particularly effective against Psychic types, with a 2x effectiveness noted. They are immune to Normal and Fighting-type moves, which cannot affect them under any circumstances. Additionally, Ghost-type Pokémon possess unique attributes that allow them to switch out freely, unaffected by any effects that might prevent such actions.\n\nGhost-type moves are categorized as Special attacks, often dealing damage while also having unique effects, such as causing confusion or sleep in targets. Notable moves include Shadow Punch, Sinister Arrow Raid, Nightmare, and Ominous Wind, each with distinct attributes and effects. Ghost moves can also interact specifically with Ghost-type Pokémon, showcasing their supernatural elements and often involving critical hits or status effects like flinching.\n\nOverall, the Ghost classification in Pokémon signifies a rich blend of spectral abilities, strategic advantages in battles, and a thematic connection to the supernatural, making it a unique and intriguing aspect of the Pokémon world.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1744477566, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44added55e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 278, "prompt_tokens": 1469, "total_tokens": 1747, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
