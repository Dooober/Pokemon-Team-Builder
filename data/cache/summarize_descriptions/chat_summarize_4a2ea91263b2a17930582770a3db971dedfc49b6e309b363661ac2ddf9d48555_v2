These moves typically inflict damage based on the user's special attack power and the target's Special Defense stat, distinguishing them from physical moves that rely on physical attack power. \n\nSpecial moves encompass a wide variety of attacks, including notable examples such as Shock Wave, Water Gun, Water Pulse, Ice Burn, Leaf Storm, Meteor Beam, Oblivion Wing, and Ominous Wind. Many of these moves not only deal damage but also possess unique effects, which can include elemental damage or status conditions that affect the target in various ways. \n\nIn Pokémon battles, Special moves are known for their higher damage potential and unique attributes, often involving indirect effects or elemental interactions. They are an essential aspect of battle strategy, as they allow Pokémon to utilize their special abilities effectively against opponents.
