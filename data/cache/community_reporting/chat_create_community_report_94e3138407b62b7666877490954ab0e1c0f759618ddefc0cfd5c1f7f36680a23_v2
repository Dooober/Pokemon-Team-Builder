However, the requirement to recharge after its use adds a layer of tactical consideration, as the user cannot move during the next turn. This makes Hyper Beam a double-edged sword, capable of delivering significant damage but also leaving the user vulnerable.

It is known for its significant damage potential and is associated with various Pokémon, including Porygon. The move is classified as a special attack, but some descriptions also refer to it as a physical move, which may indicate a misunderstanding or variation in its classification in different contexts. Regardless, Hyper Beam requires the user to recharge on the next turn after its use, meaning the user cannot move during that turn. This recharge requirement applies even if the target is not knocked out, emphasizing the strategic consideration needed when using this move in battle.\",5\r\n2067,HYDRO CANNON,\"Hydro Cannon is a powerful Water-type move in Pokémon battles, characterized by its high power of 150 and an accuracy of 90%. It is classified as a special move, meaning it primarily relies on the user's Special Attack stat. However, after using Hydro Cannon, the user must recharge and cannot move on the next turn. This recharge requirement is a significant aspect of the move, as it necessitates strategic planning during battles to mitigate the vulnerability that follows its use. Overall, Hydro Cannon is recognized for its strength and the tactical considerations it imposes on the user.\",5\r\n2066,HIGH JUMP KICK,\"High Jump Kick is a powerful Fighting-type move in Pokémon battles characterized by its high damage potential and associated risks.
