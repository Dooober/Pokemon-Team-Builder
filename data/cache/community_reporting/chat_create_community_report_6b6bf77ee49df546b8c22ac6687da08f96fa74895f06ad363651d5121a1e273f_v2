Overall, Cute Charm enhances the dynamics of Pokémon battles by leveraging the mechanics of infatuation.\",4\r\n1200,COLOR CHANGE,\"Color Change is an ability that alters a Pokémon's type to match the type of a move it is struck by, provided that it does not already possess that type. This ability allows for dynamic changes in a Pokémon's type during battle, enhancing its adaptability and strategic options.\",3\r\n1201,COMPOUND EYES,\"Compound Eyes is a Pokémon ability that enhances the accuracy of a Pokémon's moves by multiplying it by 1.3 times.

This format serves as a classification tier, allowing certain Pokémon, such as Emboar, to compete based on their strength and competitive viability. ZUBL includes Pokémon that have been banned from the ZU tier due to their potential effectiveness in battles. Overall, ZUBL establishes a unique set of rules and conditions under which these Pokémon can engage in competition, providing a structured environment for players to explore underused Pokémon.\",2\r\n425,ADAPTABILITY,\"Adaptability is an ability associated with certain Pokémon, notably Eevee, that enhances their offensive capabilities by increasing the effectiveness of their same-type moves. Specifically, this ability boosts the same-type attack bonus (STAB) from the standard multiplier of 1.5 to 2. As a result, Pokémon with the Adaptability ability can deal significantly more damage with moves that match their type, making it a valuable trait in battles.\",20\r\n1170,AFTERMATH,\"Aftermath is an ability associated with the Pokémon ZUBL. This ability triggers when ZUBL is knocked out by a contact move, resulting in the opponent losing 1/4 of its maximum HP. Additionally, Aftermath also affects the user of the contact move, causing them to lose 1/4 of their maximum HP if the Pokémon with Aftermath faints. This unique mechanic adds a strategic element to battles, as it can influence the outcome by dealing damage to the opponent upon ZUBL's defeat.\",2\r\n1203,CURSED BODY,\"Cursed Body is a Pokémon ability that provides a 30% chance to disable a move that hits the Pokémon.

Specifically, it notifies the Pokémon if any foe has a supereffective or one-hit knockout (OHKO) move upon switch-in. This ability causes the Pokémon to shudder in response to such threats, thereby providing a crucial advantage in battle by allowing the Pokémon to prepare for potentially devastating attacks.\",4\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1433,POKEMON,CUTE CHARM,Pokemon can have the ability Cute Charm which can infatuate opponents,152\r\n1431,POKEMON,COLOR CHANGE,Pokemon can have the ability Color Change which alters its type,151\r\n1432,POKEMON,COMPOUND EYES,Pokemon can have the ability Compound Eyes which increases move accuracy,150\r\n997,ZUBL,ADAPTABILITY,\"ZUBL possesses the ability Adaptability, which enhances its attack capabilities in battles\",22\r\n3007,ADAPTABILITY,AFTERMATH,\"Adaptability and Aftermath are both abilities that significantly influence Pokémon in battle.
