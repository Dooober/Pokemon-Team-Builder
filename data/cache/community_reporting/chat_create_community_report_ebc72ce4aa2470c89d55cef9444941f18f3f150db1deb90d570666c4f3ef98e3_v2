Ice moves can inflict freezing effects on opponents and include various attacks like Ice Ball, Ice Burn, and Ice Hammer. Additionally, Ice-type Pokémon benefit from enhanced defense during snowy conditions, further solidifying their role in defensive strategies.\n\nOverall, Ice is a classification within the Pokémon universe that encompasses a range of abilities, moves, and characteristics related to cold environments, making it a distinct and powerful type in Pokémon battles.\",57\r\n933,AVALUGG,\"Avalugg is a Pokémon characterized as an Ice type, known for its impressive defensive capabilities and unique abilities.
