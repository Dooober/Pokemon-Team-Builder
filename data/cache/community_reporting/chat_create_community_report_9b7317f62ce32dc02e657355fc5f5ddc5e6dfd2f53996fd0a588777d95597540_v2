Specifically, it allows the user to gain half of the HP inflicted, with a power of 100 and an accuracy of 100%. This special move is effective only against sleeping opponents, making it a strategic choice in battles where the target is incapacitated. Overall, Dream Eater serves as a powerful tool for regaining health while simultaneously dealing damage to adversaries in a vulnerable state.\",8\r\n1704,DOOM DESIRE,\"DOOM DESIRE is a Pokémon move that is characterized as a special attack, hitting two turns after being used. It deals significant damage, with a power of 140 and an accuracy of 100. However, there are conflicting descriptions regarding its type and categorization; while it is primarily described as a special move, one description categorizes it as a steel-type physical attack with a power of 120 and an accuracy of 85. Despite these discrepancies, the core feature of DOOM DESIRE remains that it strikes two turns after being executed, making it a strategic choice in battles.\",7\r\n1705,DOUBLE-EDGE,\"DOUBLE-EDGE is a powerful physical move in Pokémon battles that deals significant damage to opponents. It has a base power of 120 and an accuracy of 100. However, this move comes with a drawback, as it inflicts a recoil effect on the user, causing them to take 33% recoil damage. Some descriptions also mention a recoil effect of 1/4, but this is resolved to align with the more consistent 33% recoil noted in other descriptions. Overall, DOUBLE-EDGE is recognized for its high damage output while simultaneously posing a risk to the user due to the recoil effect.\",5\r\n3223,DRAINING KISS,\"DRAINING KISS is a Fairy-type move that enables the user to recover 75% of the damage dealt to the target.

This move is notable for its ability to inflict burn status on opponents, which can be advantageous during battles.\",1\r\n3222,DRAGON ENERGY,\"DRAGON ENERGY is a special move characterized by its unique mechanics, where its power diminishes as the user's HP decreases. Initially, it has a base power of 150 and an accuracy of 100, allowing it to effectively hit one or more foes. However, as the user's health diminishes, the effectiveness of DRAGON ENERGY correspondingly decreases, impacting its overall damage output. This move is notable for its strategic implications in battles, as players must manage their health to maximize its potential.\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1126,DREAM EATER,POWER,\"Dream Eater has a high power rating and can only be used on sleeping targets, allowing for health recovery.\",53\r\n1120,DOOM DESIRE,POWER,\"Doom Desire has a high power rating, making it a strong move in battles.\",52\r\n1122,DOUBLE-EDGE,POWER,Double-Edge has a high power rating but also causes recoil damage to the user.,50\r\n2412,DRAINING KISS,ELECTRIC,\"Both are types of moves used in Pokémon battles, showcasing different elemental strategies\",47\r\n5216,DREAM EATER,EMBER,\"Dream Eater and Ember are both special moves that can inflict damage and have additional effects, used in Pokémon battles.\",9\r\n2411,DRAGON ENERGY,DRAINING KISS,Both are moves that have unique effects related to the user's health and damage output,5\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
