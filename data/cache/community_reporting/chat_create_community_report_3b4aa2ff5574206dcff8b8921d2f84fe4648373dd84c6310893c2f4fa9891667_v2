This move is categorized as a Normal type and is characterized by a Power of 0 and a Priority of 0, indicating that it does not deal damage. As a non-damaging event, Copycat provides versatility in battles by enabling the user to replicate the last action taken by the target, thereby enhancing tactical options during gameplay.\",5\r\n1475,STRING SHOT,\"String Shot is a non-damaging move used in Pokémon battles that primarily affects the Speed of the opponent(s). It is designed to lower the Speed of the target by 2 stages, thereby hindering their ability to attack first and act quickly in battle. However, there are conflicting descriptions regarding the extent of the Speed reduction, with some sources stating that it lowers Speed by 1 stage instead. To resolve this contradiction, it can be concluded that String Shot consistently lowers the foe's Speed by 2 stages, as this is the most frequently mentioned effect. Overall, String Shot serves as a strategic move to impede opponents' speed, enhancing the user's chances of striking first in subsequent turns.\",5\r\n1469,FAIL COPYCAT,\"Fail Copycat is a condition that affects the use of the Copycat move in Pokémon battles. Specifically, it prevents the successful execution of the Copycat move under certain circumstances. This condition arises when Copycat is the last move used by any Pokémon, resulting in its failure. Additionally, Fail Copycat serves as a flag indicating that a move cannot be copied by Copycat if it has failed previously. This limitation impacts battle strategies, as it restricts the ability to utilize the Copycat move effectively in various scenarios. Overall, Fail Copycat is a crucial factor to consider when planning moves in Pokémon battles, as it can significantly influence the outcome of a match.\",1\r\n3102,FAIL MIMIC,\"Fail Mimic is a condition that affects the use of the Mimic move in specific circumstances. It serves as a flag indicating that the Mimic move cannot be utilized if certain conditions are met. Specifically, Fail Mimic prevents the Mimic move from being executed if it is the last move used by the target or if the move itself fails. This condition influences battle strategies by restricting the ability to copy certain moves, thereby impacting the overall effectiveness of the Mimic move in gameplay.\",1\r\n1462,DEFOG,\"Defog is a non-damaging move in Pokémon battles that primarily serves two functions: it lowers the opponent's evasion and clears hazards from the battlefield. Specifically, Defog reduces the target's evasion, making it easier for the user's attacks to hit. Additionally, it removes hazards and terrain effects from both the user's and the opponent's side of the field, as well as clearing screens on the target's side. Defog is categorized as a Flying-type move, with a Power of 0 and a Priority of 0, indicating that it does not deal damage but plays a strategic role in battle by enhancing the user's chances of landing hits and maintaining a clear battlefield.\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2291,COPYCAT,STRING SHOT,\"Copycat can mimic any move, including String Shot, showing a direct relationship\",10\r\n1471,STRING SHOT,COSMIC POWER,Both String Shot and Cosmic Power are non-damaging moves that affect the user's or foe's stats,8\r\n2292,COPYCAT,FAIL COPYCAT,\"Fail Copycat indicates conditions under which the Copycat move cannot be used, showing a direct relationship\",6\r\n2293,COPYCAT,FAIL MIMIC,\"Fail Mimic indicates conditions under which Copycat cannot be used, showing a direct relationship\",6\r\n4874,DEFOG,STRING SHOT,\"Defog and String Shot both affect the battlefield conditions, with Defog clearing hazards and String Shot lowering opponent's Speed.\",6\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
